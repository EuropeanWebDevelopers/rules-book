# European Web Developers

EWD is a group based on respect for expertise and the other members.
It was born to gather the finest european web developers under the same digital roof, to share ideas and opinions with mutual respect and on the edge of free possibilities.
Whenever a paid solution is needed to be proposed, it's mandatory to give any details as clearly as possible.

As for any community, EWD has a clear ruleset that members need to comply with. Breaking any of those rules may result in a temporary or permanent ban from the group.


## No Slander

Threatening or insulting other members is strongly forbidden. We do not tolerate any kind of incitement to violence, race discrimination, against any gender, sexual orientation or personal ideology. Disclosing sensitive information about other people to harm them will involve the removal of such data and the instantaneous expulsion from the group.

Remember that you might not agree with someone else but this doesn't give you the right to offend, nor threaten or bother him in any way.


## No Spam

EWD agrees and fully shares all of Facebook's Terms and Conditions. In particular, please note that is forbidden to:
- Share illegal content such as pirated software and shared licences;
- Brigandage or actions against other group similar or equal to EWD;
- Promote any kind of fraud or click baiting;
- Share any kind of pornographic content.


## Anonymized Screenshots

Screenshots of other Facebook groups, GitHub comments, Reddit or any other external platform, need to be shared with as few clues as possible that could lead back to the people involved. Therefore any screenshot needs to be anonymized by censoring names, pictures or any kind of sensitive information.


# No referral link

External links to third party and/or personal projects for promotional purposes need to be free of misleading advertisement and without any kind of referral code. To share an external link with referrals you must ask for the authorization to the admins.


## No off-topics or non-constructive

The following content may be removed at the discretion of the admins/mods:
- Irrelevant content, unoriginal and shared without the aim to create a constructive discussion;
- Clearly fake content, misleading, malicious or duplicated;
- Non relevant GIFs, meme or reactions;
- Trolling or bait;
- Illegal and/or copyrighted content (books, videos, guides);
- Any other kind of off-topic content (See [exceptions](#off-topic-exceptions)).


### Off-topic Exceptions

In view of a cohesive community and to not be only tightened to a professional communication between members, `Off-Topic` content strictly related to development is allowed, such as: hardware, workstation, editor configuration, hosting and cloud information.
Anyway, as aforementioned, any link to external websites like Amazon with a referral code will be deleted straight away.
 

## No discrimination

Your age, nationality, race, gender, wealth status, sexual or spiritual orientation have no relevance inside EWD, everyone is welcome in the group. The only requirement is to understand, read and write in English.


## How to ask for help

If you need an advice remember to follow those guidelines in order to start a perfect conversation:
- Specify whether it is free or paid, in case of the latter be sure to honor the agreement in private;
- State your problem clearly, without any circumlocution;
- Attach a snippet of your troublesome code using some online tool like those ones
    - [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/)
    - [hastebin](https://hastebin.com/)
    - [JS Bin](http://jsbin.com/)
    - [CodePen](https://codepen.io/pen)

Here follows a simple template to write your post in the best way:

```
Hello everyone,
I have a problem with {Language} on {Platform} [...]
// Keep describing your issue as clear as possible, don't take anything for granted

Here are some resources:
// Links to lookalike issues on stack overflow or similar
// Link to your code snippet via Gist, Hastebin, JS Bin, Codepen, etc.

Thanks in advance for your answers.
```

Just remember that EWD is not a place to solve your school assignment, give-and-take is always a must. Whoever will try to bypass the guidelines or to overexploit the willingness of the other members, could be expelled from the group.


## Job Listing

If you're offering a job please be sure to follow those guidelines for a crystal clear job listing.

**Required content:**
- Name of the agency;
- List of the candidate's skill requirements;
- Contract type(s).

Recommended content:
- The salary amount and type (yearly remuneration range or hourly retribution for freelancer);
- List of the candidate's benefits;
- Possibility of remote work;
- Your role in the agency or how you get to know the job offer.

As well as it is mandatory to comply with the rules for who's listing a job offer, anyone not interested in the advertisement shall avoid writing inappropriate answers. Civility should be shown on both sides.

Here are some examples of comments that will be deleted:
- "The salary is too low";
- "You'll never find the candidate you're searching for";
- Any kind of irrelevant jokes or ironic assumptions.

Repeated instances of inappropriate member behavior (as for non-compliant announcements) will result in deleted comments and - in case of serious circumstances - user banishment.

Here's is a quick and effective template to start your post in the best way:

```
Hello everyone,
the agency {Agency Name} is searching for {Amount} {Candidate Type} to {Goal} [...]
// Concisely describe the agency and add details as candidate benefits, project's key points or business contacts.

The candidate should meet the following requirements:
// List the candidate's requirements in a clear way, keep it real

If hired, the candidate will get those benefit's:
// Paid annual leave, meal vouchers, etc.

// Be sure to speak clear about salary, specify if it is monthly or yearly
// if the amount is net or gross and/or if any kind of expense account is included
```


## No self-promotion

Repeated instances of reckless self-promotion of any kind of service or product inside the group, without any given approval, will result in a warning. Unrepentant members will be punished with a permanent ban.


## Events

If you're part of an event/conference staff and you want to introduce it inside the European Web Developers group, you're more than welcome.

However we have chosen to adopt some qualitative measures to avoid spam.
You can post about your event/conference under these conditions:

The event is free;
The event is NOT free, but you can make available a dedicated discount to the members of EWD (in this case you must get in touch with the admins to agree on a specific adv plan).

Please note: in any case, posts about events/conferences must always comply with the rules in this document.
